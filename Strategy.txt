Strategy:
Easy move:
if the previous spell is an empty string the bot returns a random word from the spells array otherwise
it returns the first spell from the array that hasn't been used before and that starts with the last letter from
the previous string.

Medium move:
if the previous spell is an empty string the bot returns a random word from the spells array otherwise
it returns a word that starts with the last letter from previous , that hasn't been used before and that has as
a last letter, the letter that occurs the least as the first letter.

Hard move:
if the previous spell is an empty string the bot returns the word with in which the last letter is the least likely to be first letter 
(the last is the one that has the least occurence as a first letter)
otherwise it returns a word that starts with the last letter from previous , that hasn't been used before and that has as
a last letter, the letter that occurs the least as the first letter.
